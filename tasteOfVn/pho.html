        <h2>🍜 Pho – The Quintessence of Vietnamese Cuisine</h2>
        <p>
          Pho is one of the most iconic dishes of Vietnam, often regarded as the “soul” of Vietnamese cuisine.
          Originating from the North, especially Hanoi, this dish has become a source of national pride and a
          cultural ambassador around the world. A steaming bowl of Pho with its clear, fragrant broth — rich
          with the aroma of roasted ginger, onions, and the natural sweetness of beef or chicken bones — has
          captivated both locals and international food lovers alike.

      <h3>📖 The History of Pho</h3>
      <p>
        The exact origin of pho remains a topic of debate, but most culinary historians agree that it first appeared in
        Northern Vietnam, particularly in Nam Dinh and Hanoi, in the early 20th century.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>Originally, pho was a humble street food enjoyed by working-class people. In old Hanoi, mobile pho vendors with
        their steaming pots and the melodic cry of “Phở đây!” (Pho here!) became an unforgettable part of the city’s
        morning rhythm.</p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Today, pho has transcended its humble beginnings to become a symbol of Vietnamese culture and identity. Wherever
        Vietnamese communities exist around the world, there will almost certainly be a bowl of pho — a comforting taste
        of home shared across continents.
